# Hi, I'm Shyra 👋🏽

🎮 Game Developer | 💻 Creative Coder | 🧠 Neurodivergent Night Builder

I'm a creative developer with a passion for immersive storytelling, real-time interaction, and psychological horror games. I specialize in building custom Discord and Twitch bots that engage players through branching narratives, logic puzzles, and live commands.

### 🛠 Projects I've Built:
- **Soul Trail** – A Twitch/Discord game bot where players race against time and fate
- **Shadow Trail** – A dark interactive horror story that reacts to player choices
- **Queen’s Gambit** – A soul-based logic game with high-stakes strategy
- **Ghost Trail** – A psychological horror game with puzzles, timing, and sacrifice

### 🌙 How I Work
As a neurodivergent, night-focused developer, I thrive in asynchronous, creative, and focused environments where I can build at my own rhythm. I'm open to freelance, remote, or contract roles in:
- Game Development
- Bot & Tool Creation
- Automation + QA Testing
